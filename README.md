# DataVis
A comprehensive set of VR visualization techniques and perception tasks studied in my bachelor's thesis in the Universtitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC).


# Relevant features :eyeglasses::rocket:
Implements a set of interactive environments where techniques can be tested and user studies can be conducted.
## Techniques
-   Interactive 3D Scatter plots
-   3D Line plots
-   3D Bar plots with several variations 📊
    -  Boxed
    -  Partially Boxed
    -  Reference Line
    
## Interactive tools
- Movement with joysticks 🕹️
- Pointer 🔴
- Selection tool to visualize values of the different markers 🥢

# Code
- All of the relevant code is in Assets/Behaviors/

- The folder Assets/Data contains several example input Data Sets that can be used to test the techniques.

- The folder Assets/Scenes/tests contains the experimental environment used to test the techniques.

- The scene Assets/Scenes/MainScene contains the standard environment that can be used to visualize any of the non experimental technique variations.

- The folder ExperimentData contains the input used in the experiment, with an extra column on the left that identifies the input. When used, this column should be removed.
